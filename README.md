# Internship-Sentimental-Analysis
I did a internship on Data Science and Machine Learning in which I created a machine learning model which would predict the sentiment(positve, negative, neutral) of the tweet entered by the user.

The technologies used were python, Data Science , Naive Bayes ML Algorithm, Flak, HTML and CSS.
